## Commands

```bash
superhuman skills search "calendar"
superhuman skills install <slug>
superhuman skills install <slug> --version <version>
superhuman skills update <slug>
superhuman skills update --all
superhuman skills list
superhuman skills list --eligible
superhuman skills info <name>
superhuman skills check
```

`search`/`install`/`update` use ClawHub directly and install into the active
workspace `skills/` directory. `list`/`info`/`check` still inspect the local
skills visible to the current workspace and config.

This CLI `install` command downloads skill folders from ClawHub. Gateway-backed
skill dependency installs triggered from onboarding or Skills settings use the
separate `skills.install` request path instead.
